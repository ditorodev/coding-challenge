# Coding challenge: Apartments search
* Create a simple page to search for apartments. Here's one example of how it could look like (including bonus features):

* An apartment should have:
  - title
  - price
  - sqm
  - number of bedrooms
  - number of bathrooms
* Add filters for the search: per price, per sqm, per # of bedrooms… 
* Bonus points!
  * Add a picture per listing
  * Add lat/long, search by location (use Google Maps API)
* Feel free to style it up as you wish, no need to make it look like the example above.

## Technology and instructions:
* Backend: Ruby on Rails if you know it, something else otherwise (Node.js, Java, Python…). 
* Frontend: React or React Native if you know it, something else otherwise (even plain HTML/CSS) 
* We encourage you to use frameworks and libraries to speed up application development and write as little code as possible.
* **Important**: Have some kind of automated testing: backend or frontend
* Use git, upload it to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket/etc or send us the code including the .git folder
* Add a small setup guide to test the app locally
* You can take as much time as you want for the task, we expect an answer by a week or two. We're also interviewing other candidates for this position, so a quick turnout can give you an advantage ;)
